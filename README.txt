This program allows you to "play" a one-octave piano using your computer keyboard or using some prewritten songs.

To run this project  you have to run it on replit, as it imports the replit audio package. All other modules are included in the files or are inbuilt to python (graphics, time, os, sys).

You also need to be a replit "Explorer" to run the audio. You can sign up as an explorer by going to your account (at the top right), then under "Roles", checking the box for the "Explorer" role.

There are no install links for any required modules.

List of files in this project:
- main.py
- graphics.py
- piano.py
- README.txt
- songs.txt

Known bugs:
The piano can only play one note at a time, and by default each note is 0.35 seconds long. This prevents the user from playing chords and sets an upper limit on how fast you can play the piano.
